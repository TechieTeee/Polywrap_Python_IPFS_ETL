# Polywrap Python IPFS ETL

# About
This project showcases the potential of decentralized ETL by leveraging the capabilities of Polywrap and IPFS. Polywrap offers a powerful mechanism for building, deploying, and utilizing decentralized data pipelines, while IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) serves as a distributed file system that enhances data storage, retrieval, and sharing. The project demonstrates the creation of an ETL pipeline utilizing these technologies, emphasizing decentralized data processing.

# Running the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   `pip install pandas polywrap_client`
5. Upload your data to IPFS and obtain the IPFS CID (Content Identifier) of the uploaded data.
6. Update the code with the obtained IPFS CID in the args dictionary.
7. Execute the Python script:
   `python main.py`
